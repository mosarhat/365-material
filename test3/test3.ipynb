    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We are planning a trip from Kingston to NYC along a fixed road (no choice in what road to take). Along the way, there are multiple gas station at known locations. Our car has limited fuel capacity meaning we will need to stop for gas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize the number of fuel stops while ensuring we reach our destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize, we should travel as far as possible before refuelling. We only stop at a gas station if we cannot reach the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some assumptions we can make:\n",
    "- The distance between two consecutive gas stations is never greater than the maximum distance we can travel on a full tank.\n",
    "- We know the exact distance between all stations.\n",
    "- At any given moment, we know how much gas is left, and how far we can travel with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be solved using a recursive algorithm, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort the stations $\\{s_0, s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\\}$ according to how far they are from Kingston, where $s_n$ will be NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "```latex\n",
    "RoadTrip($s_i$) # this is a recursive function which assumes we are at a station $s_i$ with a tank full of gas\n",
    "    $t = i + 1$ # this represents the next stations\n",
    "    while $t < n$ and $s_{t+1}$ is reachable: # if the next station is reachable, and we aren't in NYC yet, incremenet\n",
    "        $t++$\n",
    "    if $t$ == $n$: \n",
    "        stop # we have arrived in NYC\n",

    "- Does the problem always have an optimal solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "This depends on the problem constraints. Some problems have an optimal solution, while others may have edge cases where no solution that is valid exists. \n",
    "\n",
    "If constraints allow for a valid solution, an optimal solution is guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to formalize our intuitive algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to utilize mathematical induction and an algorithm description to formalize an intuitive algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the algorithm description:\n",
    "- We need to clearly state the greedy choice criterion.\n",
    "- We need to defined how the solution is constructed, which can either be iterative or recursive. \n",
    "- Provide pseudocode to clarify the steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is its time complexity?\n",
    "    - Because we have to sort algorithms, the best sorting algorithms all run in O($nlogn$) time. This is true for both the iterative and recursive solutions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Does the algorithm always find an optimal solution? Proof?\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy algorithm does not always guarantee an optimal solution for all problems. While some problems (such as Activity Selection or the Road Trip problem) exhibit greedy choice property and optimal substructure, others (such as Coin Change for arbitrary denominations or Knapsack Problem) do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counterexample: Coin Change Problem (Greedy Fails)\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you need to make amount = 6 with coin denominations {1, 3, 4}:\n",
    "\n",
    "A greedy approach would pick the largest coin first: 4, leaving 2 to be made.\n",
    "Since 2 cannot be made using 4 or 3, the greedy approach fails.\n",
    "The optimal solution is {3, 3}, requiring fewer coins.\n",
    "Thus, greedy fails because choosing the locally optimal step does not always lead to a globally optimal solution."
